# Bézier-Curve
This project offers an interactive Bézier curve visualizer using De Casteljau's algorithm. Users can add, move, or delete control points, with real-time curve updates. It includes recursive subdivision to split the curve into segments for precise approximation and compares the original with the subdivided curve.
